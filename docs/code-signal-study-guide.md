To prepare for the General Coding Assessment (GCA) in Java, based on the provided framework, you need to focus on core
programming skills that align with the tasks outlined in the assessment. The GCA tests a range of abilities from basic
coding to problem-solving, with tasks increasing in complexity from Task 1 (easiest) to Task 4 (hardest). Below is a
tailored study guide for Java, followed by representative problems with solutions and key insights, emphasizing medium
and hard problems.

### Study Guide for GCA in Java

The GCA framework emphasizes fundamental programming skills, with tasks testing basic operations, data manipulation,
implementation, and problem-solving. Here’s what to sharpen up on in Java, mapped to the expected knowledge for each
task:

#### 1. Basic Coding (Task 1: Very Basic Task)

- **String Manipulation**:
  - Splitting strings: `String.split()`
  - Modifying strings: Use `StringBuilder` for efficient manipulation, as `String` is immutable
  - Basic operations: `substring()`, `charAt()`, `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`, `trim()`
  - Concatenation and comparison: `+`, `equals()`, `compareTo()`
- **Integer Manipulation**:
  - Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  - Converting strings to integers: `Integer.parseInt()`
  - Handling edge cases: Check for overflow using `long` or `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
- **Array Manipulation**:
  - Iterating over arrays: `for` loops, enhanced `for` loops
  - Modifying elements: Direct indexing (`array[i] = value`)
  - Basic operations: Sum, average, finding min/max
- **Key Java Concepts**:
  - Syntax: Writing clean, correct Java code (e.g., `public class`, `main` method)
  - Input/output: Reading input with `Scanner`, printing with `System.out.println()`
  - Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`
  - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`

#### 2. Data Manipulation (Task 2: Simple Data Manipulation)

- **Advanced String Manipulation**:
  - Splitting into substrings and processing: Use `split()` with regex
  - Reversing strings: `StringBuilder.reverse()` or manual iteration
  - Comparing and concatenating: `String.join()`, `StringBuilder.append()`
  - Parsing complex strings: Extract digits or specific patterns
- **Array Manipulation**:
  - Modifying arrays: Reversing, sorting (`Arrays.sort()`), filtering based on conditions
  - Creating new arrays: Copying with `Arrays.copyOf()` or manual allocation
  - Nested loops: Processing arrays with 1-2 levels of nesting
- **Number Manipulation**:
  - Splitting numbers into digits: Convert to string or use modulo (`% 10`)
  - Mathematical operations: Exponentiation (`Math.pow()`), absolute value (`Math.abs()`)
- **Key Java Concepts**:
  - Collections: Basic use of `ArrayList` for dynamic arrays
  - StringBuilder: Efficient string manipulation for multiple modifications
  - Exception handling: `try-catch` for input validation

#### 3. Implementation (Task 3: Implementation Task)

- **Two-Dimensional Arrays**:
  - Creating and iterating: `int[][] matrix = new int[rows][cols]`
  - Modifying: Swap rows/columns, rotate, transpose
  - Accessing elements: Handle boundary conditions
- **HashMaps**:
  - Using `HashMap`: `put()`, `get()`, `containsKey()`, `keySet()`, `values()`
  - Storing strings/integers as keys: Common for counting frequencies or mappings
  - Iterating over entries: `entrySet()` for key-value pairs
- **Breaking Down Problems**:
  - Modular coding: Write helper methods to split tasks
  - Implementing comparators: Custom sorting with `Comparator` or `Comparable`
  - Merging data: Combine arrays/strings based on specific rules
- **Key Java Concepts**:
  - Object-oriented programming: Classes, objects, methods
  - Method decomposition: Break tasks into smaller functions
  - Code readability: Meaningful variable names, consistent indentation

#### 4. Problem-Solving (Task 4: Problem-Solving Task)

- **HashMaps and Sets**:
  - Advanced use: Optimize queries with `HashMap` or `HashSet`
  - Custom data structures: Combine `HashMap` with lists or other structures
  - Time complexity: Aim for `O(log n)` or better for operations
- **Trees** (Basic):
  - Understanding tree structures: Nodes with left/right children
  - Traversals: Inorder, preorder, postorder (recursive or iterative)
  - Basic operations: Insert, search, or transform trees
- **Brute-Force Search**:
  - Checking all possibilities: Generate permutations or combinations
  - Optimizing brute force: Use pruning with `HashSet` or early termination
- **Discrete Mathematics**:
  - Basics: Counting, permutations, combinations
  - Logic: Conditional checks, bit manipulation (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`)
- **Key Java Concepts**:
  - Data structures: `TreeMap`, `TreeSet` for sorted data
  - Recursion: Solve tree or combinatorial problems
  - Time/space complexity: Analyze and optimize solutions

#### General Java Tips for GCA

- **Language Flexibility**: GCA allows any language, so leverage Java’s built-in
  libraries (`Arrays`, `Collections`, `StringBuilder`) to simplify tasks.
- **Code Quality**: Use consistent indentation, descriptive variable names, and avoid hardcoding. Follow Google Style
  Guides (e.g., camelCase for variables).
- **Speed**: Practice solving problems within time constraints (10–30 minutes per task).
- **Plagiarism**: Write original code; avoid copying solutions.
- **Environment**: Familiarize yourself with online coding platforms (e.g., CodeSignal’s editor) and practice in a
  proctored-like setting.

### Representative Problems and Solutions

Below are four problems, one for each GCA task, increasing in difficulty from Task 1 (easiest) to Task 4 (hardest).
We’ll focus more on Tasks 2–4 (medium and hard) with detailed explanations and key insights. Each problem includes a
Java solution, expected time complexity, and principles to understand.

#### Task 1: Very Basic Task

**Problem**: Given an array of integers `a`, return an array `b` where `b[i] = a[i-1] + a[i] + a[i+1]`. If an element
does not exist, treat it as 0.

**Expected Time**: 10 minutes  
**Code Length**: 5–10 lines  
**Knowledge**: Basic array iteration, boundary handling

**Solution**:

```java
public int[] sumNeighbors(int[] a) {
    int n = a.length;
    int[] b = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int left = (i > 0) ? a[i - 1] : 0;
        int right = (i < n - 1) ? a[i + 1] : 0;
        b[i] = left + a[i] + right;
    }
    return b;
}
```

**Key Insights**:

- **Boundary Conditions**: Check array indices to avoid `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Use
  conditionals (`i > 0`, `i < n-1`) to handle edges.
- **Simple Iteration**: A single loop suffices, making it `O(n)` time complexity.
- **Code Clarity**: Use descriptive variable names (`left`, `right`) and avoid magic numbers.

**Why It’s Easy**: The task is straightforward, requiring only basic array access and arithmetic. No optimization or
complex logic is needed.

#### Task 2: Simple Data Manipulation (Medium)

**Problem**: Given a list of words (lowercase English letters) and a camelCase word, check if the camelCase word can be
formed by concatenating words from the list. Return `true` if possible, `false` otherwise.  
**Example**:

- Words: `["is", "valid", "word"]`, camelCase: `"isValidWord"` → `true`
- Words: `["is", "valid"]`, camelCase: `"isWord"` → `false`

**Expected Time**: 15 minutes  
**Code Length**: 10–20 lines  
**Knowledge**: String manipulation, iteration, case handling

**Solution**:

```java
public boolean isValidCamelCase(String[] words, String camelCase) {
    // Convert words to a set for O(1) lookup
    Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(words));

    // Convert camelCase to lowercase for comparison
    String lowerCamel = camelCase.toLowerCase();
    int n = lowerCamel.length();

    // Try all possible splits
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        String first = lowerCamel.substring(0, i);
        if (wordSet.contains(first)) {
            String rest = lowerCamel.substring(i);
            if (rest.isEmpty() || wordSet.contains(rest)) {
                // Check if splitting respects camelCase (first letter of each word is capitalized)
                if (isCamelCaseMatch(camelCase, first, rest)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

private boolean isCamelCaseMatch(String camelCase, String first, String rest) {
    // Check if camelCase starts with first word and rest matches
    String expected = first + (rest.isEmpty() ? "" : Character.toUpperCase(rest.charAt(0)) + rest.substring(1));
    return camelCase.equals(expected);
}
```

**Key Insights**:

- **String Splitting**: Iterate through possible prefixes of the camelCase word to find valid splits. Use `substring()`
  to extract parts.
- **HashSet for Lookup**: Store words in a `HashSet` for `O(1)` containment checks, reducing time complexity.
- **Case Handling**: Convert to lowercase for comparison, but verify the camelCase format (e.g., `isValid` requires `is`
  followed by `Valid` with a capital `V`).
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the length of `camelCase` and `m` is the average word length (due to
  substring operations and set lookups). Space complexity is `O(k)` for the `HashSet`, where `k` is the number of words.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle empty `rest`, invalid splits, and case mismatches.

**Why It’s Medium**: Requires combining string manipulation, set usage, and case-sensitive logic. The task is
well-defined but involves multiple steps and careful handling of string properties.

**Principles**:

- **Divide and Conquer**: Break the problem into checking prefixes and verifying the remainder.
- **Use Built-in Tools**: Leverage `HashSet` and `String` methods to simplify logic.
- **Validate Constraints**: Ensure the solution respects camelCase formatting.

#### Task 3: Implementation Task (Medium-Hard)

**Problem**: Given two strings, merge them using a custom merge function. Instead of lexicographical order, compare
characters based on their frequency in their respective strings. Characters with fewer occurrences are considered
smaller; if frequencies are equal, compare lexicographically; if still equal, prefer the character from the first
string.  
**Example**:

- Input: `s1 = "aabc"`, `s2 = "aab"`
- Output: `"aaabbc"` (merge based on frequency: `a` has 2 in `s1`, 2 in `s2`, so compare lexicographically; `b` has 1
  in `s1`, 1 in `s2`; `c` has 1 in `s1`, 0 in `s2`)

**Expected Time**: 20 minutes  
**Code Length**: 25–40 lines  
**Knowledge**: HashMaps, custom comparators, two-pointer technique

**Solution**:

```java
public String mergeStrings(String s1, String s2) {
    // Count frequencies
    Map<Character, Integer> freq1 = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Character, Integer> freq2 = new HashMap<>();

    for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {
        freq1.put(c, freq1.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (char c : s2.toCharArray()) {
        freq2.put(c, freq2.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    }

    // Two-pointer merge
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    int i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < s1.length() && j < s2.length()) {
        char c1 = s1.charAt(i);
        char c2 = s2.charAt(j);

        // Compare based on frequency
        int f1 = freq1.getOrDefault(c1, 0);
        int f2 = freq2.getOrDefault(c2, 0);

        if (f1 < f2) {
            result.append(c1);
            i++;
        } else if (f2 < f1) {
            result.append(c2);
            j++;
        } else {
            // Equal frequencies, compare lexicographically
            if (c1 <= c2) {
                result.append(c1);
                i++;
            } else {
                result.append(c2);
                j++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Append remaining characters
    while (i < s1.length()) {
        result.append(s1.charAt(i++));
    }
    while (j < s2.length()) {
        result.append(s2.charAt(j++));
    }

    return result.toString();
}
```

**Key Insights**:

- **Frequency Counting**: Use `HashMap` to store character frequencies for both strings. This allows `O(1)` frequency
  lookups during merging.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: Treat the strings as sorted sequences and merge them like in merge sort, but with a custom
  comparison rule.
- **Custom Comparator**: Implement the comparison logic: frequency first, then lexicographical order, with preference
  for `s1` if equal. This requires careful conditional checks.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)` where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` (frequency counting is `O(n + m)`,
  merging is `O(n + m)`). Space complexity is `O(k)` where `k` is the number of unique characters.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle characters not present in one string, equal frequencies, and remaining characters after one
  string is exhausted.

**Why It’s Medium-Hard**: Requires implementing a specific merge function with multiple comparison criteria, combining
data structures (`HashMap`) and algorithmic techniques (two-pointer). The task is clearly defined but demands careful
coding.

**Principles**:

- **Precomputation**: Calculate frequencies upfront to simplify the merge process.
- **Modular Logic**: Separate frequency counting and merging for clarity.
- **Handle Comparisons**: Break down the comparison into frequency, lexicographical, and tie-breaker steps.

#### Task 4: Problem-Solving Task (Hard)

**Problem**: Create a data structure that supports the following operations:

- `insert x y`: Insert an object with key `x` and value `y`.
- `get x`: Return the value of the object with key `x`.
- `addToKey x`: Add `x` to all keys in the map.
- `addToValue y`: Add `y` to all values in the map.  
  Each operation should have `O(log n)` time complexity.

**Expected Time**: 30 minutes  
**Code Length**: 20–35 lines  
**Knowledge**: HashMaps, offset tracking, problem-solving

**Solution**:

```java
class CustomMap {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> map; // Stores key-value pairs
    private long keyOffset; // Tracks global key additions
    private long valueOffset; // Tracks global value additions

    public CustomMap() {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        keyOffset = 0;
        valueOffset = 0;
    }

    public void insert(int x, int y) {
        // Adjust for offsets: store x - keyOffset, y - valueOffset
        map.put(x - keyOffset, y - valueOffset);
    }

    public int get(int x) {
        // Adjust key for keyOffset, retrieve value and add valueOffset
        Integer value = map.get(x - keyOffset);
        if (value == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Key not found");
        }
        return (int) (value + valueOffset);
    }

    public void addToKey(int x) {
        // Increment keyOffset by x
        keyOffset += x;
    }

    public void addToValue(int y) {
        // Increment valueOffset by y
        valueOffset += y;
    }
}
```

**Key Insights**:

- **Offset Tracking**: Instead of updating all keys/values in the map (which would be `O(n)`), maintain `keyOffset`
  and `valueOffset` to track global additions. Adjust keys and values during `insert` and `get` operations.
- **HashMap Usage**: Use a `HashMap` for `O(1)` average-case insert and get operations. The offsets ensure `addToKey`
  and `addToValue` are `O(1)`, but the problem specifies `O(log n)`, suggesting a balanced tree (e.g., `TreeMap`) could
  be used for guaranteed `O(log n)`. For simplicity, we use `HashMap` with average-case efficiency.
- **Key Adjustment**: When inserting, store `x - keyOffset` as the key and `y - valueOffset` as the value. When
  retrieving, use `x - keyOffset` to find the key and add `valueOffset` to the value.
- **Time Complexity**: `insert`, `get`: `O(1)` average (HashMap); `addToKey`, `addToValue`: `O(1)`. If `TreeMap` is
  used, all operations are `O(log n)`. Space complexity is `O(n)` for the map.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle missing keys in `get`, overflow in offsets (use `long` to mitigate), and negative additions.

**Why It’s Hard**: Requires recognizing that updating all keys/values is inefficient and designing a solution that uses
offsets to achieve constant-time updates. The problem tests problem-solving (noticing the optimization) and data
structure design.

**Principles**:

- **Lazy Updates**: Use offsets to defer updates until necessary, reducing time complexity.
- **Data Structure Choice**: Select a structure (`HashMap` or `TreeMap`) based on time complexity requirements.
- **Mathematical Insight**: Represent key/value modifications as relative offsets to avoid iterating over the map.

1. **Task 2 (Medium)**:

- **Insight**: Break down string problems into manageable parts (e.g., prefix/suffix splits) and use efficient data
  structures (`HashSet`) for lookups.
- **Practice**: String parsing, set operations, and case handling. Solve problems like word break or string segmentation
  on LeetCode.
- **Java Tip**: Use `StringBuilder` for concatenation and `HashSet` for fast containment checks.

2. **Task 3 (Medium-Hard)**:

- **Insight**: Implement custom logic (e.g., comparators) by precomputing data (frequencies) and using algorithmic
  patterns (two-pointer).
- **Practice**: Problems involving custom sorting, merging, or frequency-based logic. Try LeetCode’s “Merge Intervals”
  or “Sort Characters by Frequency.”
- **Java Tip**: Master `HashMap` for frequency counting and two-pointer techniques for merging.
