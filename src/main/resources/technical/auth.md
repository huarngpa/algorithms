Let's dive into what a **Senior Engineer at Coinbase** on the **Data Foundations & Chain Stack** team might build, using
**Temporal**, **Spark**, **gRPC in Go**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS services**‚Äîespecially focusing on **authentication**,
**service-to-service security**, **ingestion**, and pipeline architecture.

---

## üß© 1. Ingesting Blockchain Data at Scale

### üîç Workflow with Temporal

Coinbase‚Äôs ChainStack uses **Temporal** to orchestrate ingestion flows ([github.com][1]):

1. Temporal triggers "ingest-block" workflows per block number.
2. Activities:

* Fetch raw block via **gRPC Go service** talking to archival node.
* Store payloads in **ChainStorage** (Kubernetes service + S3/DynamoDB backend).
* Kick off enrichment Spark jobs if needed.

3. Temporal coordinates retries, failures, and orchestration logic.
4. Dead-letter queues ensure resilience via SQS.

### ‚úÖ Why Temporal?

* Enables **exactly-once, resilient, durable** workflows for each block‚Äîeven with crashes.
* Supports **complex retry logic** (e.g., delay retries on missing data).
* Integrates with Go/Kubernetes cleanly.

---

## üîê 2. Authentication & Authorization in K8s + Services

### üß† Service-to-Service Authentication

* Use **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)** in EKS:

  * Each Go microservice gets a Kubernetes service account mapped to an AWS IAM role.
  * Use AWS SDK‚Äôs default credential provider to get **SigV4-signed tokens** for calling AWS services like S3,
    DynamoDB ([github.com][1], [varutra.com][2], [aws.amazon.com][3]).

* For internal HTTP/gRPC calls between services **inside Kubernetes**:

  * Use **mutual TLS (mTLS)** via Istio or AWS App Mesh.
  * Optionally attach **short-lived JWTs** signed by Coinbase‚Äôs internal IdP, validated by Envoy sidecars.

### üõ†Ô∏è API Gateway / Auth Flow

1. **Inbound**: User-facing API receives OIDC/JWT from frontend.
2. Verified by Envoy and forwarded‚Äîservices trust token claims.
3. Use JWT `sub`, roles in claims to enforce **RBAC/ABAC** within services.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Spark Orchestration & Enrichment

Coinbase uses **Spark** for batch and analytical jobs ([medium.com][4], [coinbase.com][5]):

* After ingestion of raw block data (S3), they trigger Spark (Kubernetes or EMR):

  * Jobs read from S3 via Delta/Iceberg format.
  * Decode, enrich, write back to Iceberg tables partitioned by block or date.
* Typically invoked via Temporal or Airflow/Dagster pipelines.

### üß† Service vs. Spark Security

* **Spark workers** run in EKS with IRSA to read/write S3, access logs, etc.
* Each job‚Äôs IAM role is scoped narrowly to specific buckets and Glue/Iceberg catalogs.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. Authorization & Data Access

### üîß Within Services

* Service reads JWT claims (e.g., `roles: ["engineer","analyst"], org_id`) and applies:

  * Coarse-grained checks at API layer.
  * Fine-grained logic inside, e.g., ‚Äúcan only query blocks until timestamp X‚Äù.

### üóÑÔ∏è Spark / Presto (Trino)

* Enforce catalog/table permissions via AWS Lake Formation or Iceberg ACLs.
* Use AWS‚ÄìIAM-to-Lake Formation bridge: role-based access controls provisioned per analyst group.

### üîÅ Replay & Auditability

* Temporal + Iceberg/AWS Catalog support **time-travel queries** (e.g., replay data as of block N).
* Spark jobs use checkpointed watermarks, tracked by Temporal or a metadata service.

---

## üîÅ 5. Full Flow: From Blockchain ‚Üí Analytics

1. **Temporal** kicks off block ingestion.
2. **Go/gRPC service** fetches block from node.
3. Block written securely to **ChainStorage** (K8s service backed by S3/Dynamo + DynamoDB).
4. Optionally triggers **Spark** job for batch decoding/enrichment.
5. Enriched data sits in **Iceberg** tables in S3, with permissions via Lake Formation.
6. Analysts connect via **Trino**, using IAM-authenticated queries.
7. All service-to-service communications are **mTLS-authenticated** with enforcement at the mesh layer and service-level
   RBAC.
8. AWS services (S3, Dynamo, Kinesis) are accessed via SigV4 using IRSA.

---

## üß† Why This Stack?

* **Temporal** provides durable, fine-grained pipeline control and retry logic.
* **Go + gRPC** services are efficient, typed, and work naturally with Temporal.
* **Spark** supports large-scale batch analytics and stateful processing.
* **K8s + Istio** enforce security, load balancing, and mTLS.
* **AWS IRSA + SigV4** ensure least privilege for cloud resource access.
* **Iceberg + Lake Formation** give schema management, versioning, and secure query access.
* **JWT + OIDC + Envoy** provide robust identity management.

---

## üéØ Interview Focus Points

* **Identity & least privilege**: IRSA roles, SigV4, Lake Formation ACLs.
* **Resilient pipelines**: Temporal + SQS for backoff and retries.
* **Security posture**: mTLS, Envoy JWT validation, OPA-style ABAC.
* **Analytical tractability**: Parquet/Iceberg tables, partitioning, time-travel.
* **Engineering benefits**: Developer ergonomics, audit logs, dynamic retries, cost isolation.

Let‚Äôs dive into **authentication** (who you are) and **authorization** (what you can do) in a system-design context,
starting with **AWS SigV4** and cookies, moving through **JWTs and OAuth**, and then exploring **how Coinbase and modern
industry systems manage auth**.

---

## üîê 1. AWS SigV4: Auth for API Calls

### How SigV4 Works:

* Clients **sign each HTTP request** with a hash (HMAC-SHA256) using AWS secret keys.
* The signature covers method, headers, payload, and timestamp.
* AWS validates the signature and checks expiry (usually 15 minutes).

### Why It Matters:

* ‚úÖ **Per-request auth**‚Äîfine-grained control.
* ‚úÖ **No session state**‚Äîeach request is self-authenticated.
* ‚úÖ Protects against replay attacks via timestamps and nonce.

### Use Case Fit:

* Service-to-service calls (e.g., Lambda to S3).
* Cryptographic integrity required for each request.
* Not ideal for user-facing web apps.

---

## üç™ 2. Cookies & Web Frontends

Large-scale web apps (like Amazon) often combine:

* **Cookies**: hold session IDs or JWTs; HTTP-only flags enforce security.
* **Refresh tokens**: re-issue new session tokens transparently.
* **CSRF protections**: via same-site flags and rotating tokens.

Why Cookies?

* Seamlessly work with browser (auto-sent on requests).
* Can store sessions (via backend or distributed store).
* Support SSO flows and complex frontend interactions.

Tradeoffs:

* Session state needs storage (DB, Redis).
* You need secure mechanisms to avoid CSRF and hijacking.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

### Structure:

* **Header**: algorithm & type (e.g., RS256, ES256).
* **Payload**: claims (`iss`, `sub`, `exp`, etc.).
* **Signature**: signed with secret or private key.

### Advantages:

* ‚úÖ **Stateless**‚Äîno server-side session store.
* JWTs are self-contained, verifiable via public key.
* Widely supported across languages & frameworks.

### Drawbacks:

* **Revocation is hard**‚Äîonce issued, valid until expiry.
* Large payloads ‚Üí larger headers/transmissions.
* Security concerns: algorithm confusion (`alg: none`), key rollover.

---

## üîÅ 4. OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect

### OAuth 2.0:

* Protocol for delegating access.
* Involves:

  * **Authorization Code** flow (user logs in),
  * **Client Credentials** flow (service-to-service),
  * **Refresh tokens** for long sessions.

### OpenID Connect (OIDC):

* Layer on OAuth for authentication.
* Returns an **ID token (JWT)** with user identity claims.

### Real-world Example:

* **Sign in with GitHub**: redirect to GitHub, user approves, you get access token (+ ID token), then call GitHub APIs.

### Pros:

* Fine-grained **delegated access** without passwords.
* Use **scopes** (`read:user email`) to limit API permissions.
* Industry standard for SSO.

### Cons:

* Complex flows requiring secure redirect endpoints, PKCE, token exchange.
* Requires identity and resource servers.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. API Keys & JWTs: Coinbase Developer Platform

Coinbase offers "Advanced Trade API" using:

1. **API key + secret** ‚Äî generate a short-lived JWT signed by your private
   key ([en.wikipedia.org][1], [docs.cdp.coinbase.com][2], [frontegg.com][3], [stackoverflow.com][4], [dev.to][5], [loginradius.com][6], [en.wikipedia.org][7], [stackoverflow.com][8]).
2. JWT used as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for each request‚Äîvalid for \~2 minutes ([docs.cdp.coinbase.com][2]).
3. This combines SigV4-like per-request integrity with JWT statelessness.

---

## üîê 6. Authorization: ACLs, Roles, Claims

### Access Control Models:

* **RBAC**: role-based‚Äîusers get roles (e.g., admin, user).
* **ABAC**: attribute-based‚Äîpolicies use user attributes (e.g., department).
* **PBAC / XACML**: policy-based‚Äîexternal policy engine (e.g., via OPA, XACML).

### Practice Patterns:

* Use JWT claims for `roles`, `org_id`, `permissions`.
* Token parsers verify scopes before allowing actions.
* For very sensitive ops (like trading), require additional lookup in RBAC system.

---

## üîç 7. Coinbase Practices (AWS + OAuth + JWT)

* Coinbase App and APIs:

  * Use **OAuth 2.0** for third-party
    apps ([github.com][9], [en.wikipedia.org][7], [stackoverflow.com][10], [docs.cdp.coinbase.com][11]).
  * Use **JWT-based short-lived tokens** signed with ES256 ([docs.cdp.coinbase.com][12]).
  * Access tokens must be encrypted at rest and scoped by least privilege ([docs.cdp.coinbase.com][13]).

Likely architecture:

* **Identity Provider (IdP)**: handles signup/login, issues JWTs.
* **API Gateways**: validate JWTs on each request.
* **Service Layer**: further authorization based on claims.
* **RBAC** or policy engines (Opa, Casbin) for fine-grained access.

---

## üß† 8. Modern Trends & Bleeding Edge

* **OAuth 2.1** + **PKCE everywhere**‚Äîmodern best practice ([dev.to][5]).
* **Token Binding**: bind tokens to TLS session to prevent misuse ([en.wikipedia.org][14]).
* **Hybrid Tokens**: use opaque access tokens + JWT session cookies.
* **Token introspection**: Opaque tokens validated via auth server lookup.
* **Attribute-based authorization**: dynamic ABAC replacing static RBAC.
* **Zero Trust architecture**: mTLS, service identity via SPIFFE/SPIRE.

---

## üéØ Interview Perspective

When designing auth for a Coinbase-like system, you should think:

1. **Authentication**:

* Web frontend: use **OpenID Connect** for SSO.
* API to API: use **JWT-based tokens** or **SigV4** for service calls.
* Third-party apps: use **OAuth 2.0** with short-lived tokens and refresh flows.

2. **Authorization**:

* Use JWT claims + gateway enforcement for coarse access.
* Use ABAC or policy engine for fine-grained, contextual checks.

3. **Security Considerations**:

* Minimize token lifespan.
* Use `kid` and key rotation (RS256, ES256).
* Protect against CSRF, token theft.
* Log and audit token issuance and usage.

Let‚Äôs go deep into **authorization**‚Äîespecially what **senior engineers at Coinbase** should be thinking about today,
and what the **bleeding-edge** authorization patterns look like in modern architectures.

---

## 1. üõ°Ô∏è Authorization at Coinbase ‚Äî What Really Matters

### üîç Insider & Contractor Risks

Coinbase recently faced a breach due to over-privileged third-party access‚Äîhighlighting a key risk: file system access
often falls short. You want controls that protect **data-level access**, **not just network-level
**([medium.com][1], [velotix.ai][2]). Senior engineers should focus on:

* Enforcing **least privilege** by default‚Äîaccess only to specific data rows, functions, or attributes.
* Applying **time-bound or context-aware access**, especially for contractors.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Zero Trust & Least Privilege

Zero Trust is core to Coinbase‚Äôs approach:**‚ÄúNever trust, always verify‚Äù**([cyolo.io][3]). That means:

* Everywhere: **authenticate every request**, even internal.
* Enforce **mTLS**, verify tokens at the proxy sidecars.
* Apply **dynamic, context-based policies**, not static role assignment.

### üîê Data-Centric Authorization

Instead of network-level scopes (e.g., bucket read/write), Coinbase (and similar companies) are shifting towards *
*data-centric authorization**‚Äîcontrolling access at table, row, or even cell level, and tracking who accessed what,
when([apisecurity.io][4], [cyolo.io][3], [virtru.com][5]).

---

## 2. üèóÔ∏è Modern Authorization Models: What Senior Engineers Use

| Model                      | Description                                              | When to Use                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **RBAC**                   | Roles aggregate permissions                              | Good for simple, coarse-grained access      |
| **ABAC/XACML**             | Policies using attributes of user, resource, environment | For richer, dynamic logic                   |
| **ReBAC (e.g., Zanzibar)** | Access based on relationships (e.g., friend, owner)      | When access depends on relationships        |
| **PBAC/OPA**               | Policies externalized via policy engines                 | For centralized, unified policy enforcement |

### ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)

* Common in cloud and fintech.
* E.g., policy: ‚ÄúManagers can approve transactions ‚â§ \$10K in pickup window.‚Äù
* Supports dynamic context (time, device,
  geolocation)([arxiv.org][6], [en.wikipedia.org][7], [en.wikipedia.org][8], [curity.io][9], [arxiv.org][10], [en.wikipedia.org][11]).

### ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)

* Modeled after Google's Zanzibar: ‚ÄúAlice can view document D if she is editor‚Äù([en.wikipedia.org][8]).
* Great for social networks, collaboration, or marketplace ownership models.

### Policy Engines (OPA, OpenFGA, Cedar)

* Serve as **Policy Decision Points (PDP)** separate from service logic.
* Can audit all decisions, support versioning and evolution‚Äîperfect for **auditable authorization
  **([en.wikipedia.org][7], [curity.io][9]).

---

## 3. üß† Advanced & Bleeding-Edge Trends

### üîπ Decentralized Identity & Verifiable Credentials

* Emerging frameworks: **DIDs + VCs** for agent-based identity and privacy (GDPR, eIDAS)([arxiv.org][10]).
* Coinbase could explore this for secure keyless identities across ecosystems.

### üîπ Token Binding

* Binds tokens to TLS sessions‚Äînobody can reuse stolen tokens remotely([techradar.com][12], [en.wikipedia.org][13]).
* Still emerging, but strong way to harden OAuth2/JWT against theft.

### üîπ AI & Non-Human Identities (NHIs)

* Industry tracks (Okta, Curity) show auth for **AI agents / bots** is becoming critical([en.wikipedia.org][13]).
* Coinbase must evolve to manage **per-agent policies**, token vaulting, and human-in-the-loop approvals.

### üîπ Model-Driven & Adaptive Authorization

* Use of runtime models or AI to adjust policies dynamically based on X (time, risk score,
  behavior)([techradar.com][12]).
* Think ‚Äúif user logs in from new device + unusual pattern ‚Üí require step-up auth‚Äù.

---

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Senior-Grade Authorization Architecture at Coinbase

### ‚úÖ Core Building Blocks:

1. **Identity Provider (IdP)** issues short-lived **JWTs / tokens**, with embedded claims.
2. **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** ensures service identity.
3. **Envoy/Istio sidecar** validates tokens and applies RBAC policies transparently.
4. **External Policy PDP** (like OPA/OpenFGA) consulted for fine-grained access decisions.
5. **Data Layer** (Iceberg, SQL, etc.) enforces row-column-level permissions.
6. **Behavioral Monitoring** (UEBA) flags anomalies in real time([curity.io][9], [varonis.com][14]).

### ‚úÖ Key Focus for Seniors:

* **Policy governance**: how to write, deploy, version, audit policies across services.
* **Policy performance**: PDPs must scale without adding latency‚Äîlook at caching, batching.
* **Token hygiene**: rotation, binding, revocation, and minimizing token lifetime.
* **Developer experience (DX)**: make it easy to define and test authorization rules early.
* **Auditability**: all decisions and access must be logged and traceable (gdpr, compliance).
* **Defense against insiders**: machine identities tracked, contractors time-boxed, user behavior monitored.

---

## 5. ‚úÖ Interview-Ready Architecture Sketch

**Prompt**: Design a secure trading API for Coinbase with internal and external consumers.

1. **AuthN**:

* External (apps): OAuth2 / OIDC for user logins.
* Internal services: mTLS + short-lived JWT tokens via service identity (SPIFFE).

2. **AuthZ**:

* Coarse checks at edge (Envoy): `can_trade=true`.
* Fine checks via policy engine: evaluate claims plus context (role, market data, risk).

3. **Data Access**:

* Marketplace data in Iceberg with row-level ACLs: service only sees own markets.

4. **Dynamic Policies**:

* Example: After large withdrawal, require multi-factor approval.
* Enforced via OPA + policy triggers.

5. **Auditing**: Every call logs identity, decision, policy version, context (risk flags).
6. **Runtime Rotation**:

* OIDC keys roll monthly.
* Tokens are revokable; PDP consults stale flag in cache.

---

### TL;DR Senior Takeaways:

1. **Move from static roles to dynamic, attribute/relationship-based policies**.
2. **Token binding, per-agent identity, and zero-trust are now table stakes**.
3. **Externalized, auditable PDPs** using OPA/OpenFGA/Cedar.
4. **Data-centric ACLs for real-time and historical queries**.
5. **Behavioral and policy automation**, especially with agentic/AI identities emerging.

Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs do a deep technical deep dive on **IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)**, which is *critical for
secure, least-privilege AWS access* inside **Kubernetes (K8s)** clusters ‚Äî particularly on **EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes
Service).

If you‚Äôre working at a place like **Coinbase**, where every microservice is containerized and running on EKS, **IRSA is
how pods authenticate securely to AWS** services like S3, DynamoDB, SNS, etc.

---

## üß† TL;DR: What Is IRSA?

**IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)** allows **Kubernetes Pods to assume AWS IAM roles**, using **Kubernetes-native
service accounts**, *without needing static credentials or instance profile hacks.*

**Use Case**:
Your app needs to write to `s3://my-secure-bucket` ‚Äî but only that bucket, and only from that app.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Was IRSA Introduced?

### The Problem:

Traditionally, access to AWS services from EC2/EKS was via:

* **Instance profile** (attached to EC2 nodes) ‚Üí **all pods** share the same IAM role!
* Risk of **over-privileged pods** or **lateral movement** between pods.

### The Solution:

IRSA **decouples IAM from the node** and links it to the **K8s service account** used by your pod.

---

## üîê How IRSA Works: Step-by-Step

### 1. You Enable OIDC Provider on Your EKS Cluster

```bash
aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer"
```

This is the URL AWS will use to verify tokens issued by Kubernetes.

You then associate this OIDC provider with your AWS account:

```bash
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
  --url https://oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/<EXAMPLE> \
  --thumbprint <THUMBPRINT> \
  --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com
```

‚úÖ This tells AWS to trust tokens signed by your EKS control plane‚Äôs identity provider.

---

### 2. You Create an IAM Role with a Trust Policy for That OIDC Provider

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE:sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:my-service-account"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy says:

> *‚ÄúAllow any pod using the `my-service-account` in the `default` namespace to assume this role using a web identity
token.‚Äù*

---

### 3. You Annotate the K8s Service Account with the IAM Role ARN

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-service-account
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/my-irsa-role
```

Now, any pod using this service account will get the permissions of that role.

---

### 4. When the Pod Starts, the K8s Token Is Mounted Into `/var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount`

* This token is a **signed OIDC JWT**.
* The AWS SDK inside the pod uses this token to **call STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity**.
* It gets **temporary IAM credentials** (AccessKey, Secret, SessionToken) valid for a short time.
* These are cached by the SDK and **rotated transparently**.

## üß© What‚Äôs Happening Under the Hood

| Step           | Component  | Action                                           |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pod starts     | Kubernetes | Mounts OIDC token for service account            |
| AWS SDK starts | App or SDK | Reads token, calls STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity |
| AWS STS        | AWS IAM    | Verifies token against trusted OIDC provider     |
| STS response   | AWS        | Returns short-lived IAM credentials              |
| App            | AWS SDK    | Uses credentials to call S3, Dynamo, etc.        |

## ‚úÖ Benefits of IRSA

| Benefit             | Why It Matters                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Fine-grained IAM    | Each pod/service has its own least-privilege permissions |
| No shared secrets   | No long-lived access keys in env vars or files           |
| Secure by design    | Authenticated via signed OIDC tokens                     |
| Rotated credentials | STS tokens expire and are refreshed automatically        |
| Audit-friendly      | Actions are logged under the assumed role                |

---

## üí° Real-World Example: Secure Spark on EKS

* Spark job runs in a K8s pod.
* Uses a service account `spark-data-role` that maps to IRSA role `arn:aws:iam::...:role/spark-data-irsa`.
* That role allows:

  * `s3:GetObject` on `s3://chain-ingest-data/`
  * `glue:GetTable` on catalog `block_events`
* Spark driver and executors pick up those credentials via the pod‚Äôs token ‚Üí no IAM credentials passed manually.

---

## üß† Senior Engineer Considerations

### 1. üîí Enforce Least Privilege

* Use **granular IAM policies**: don‚Äôt give `s3:*`, give `s3:GetObject` for a specific prefix.
* Attach **only the IRSA role needed** for that job/service.

### 2. üßº Rotate and Expire

* STS tokens expire every hour ‚Äî SDKs refresh automatically, but long-running jobs must be able to re-authenticate.

### 3. üîç Audit

* Use **CloudTrail** to track who assumed what role, and from where.
* Tag IRSA roles for team/project attribution.

### 4. üí• Fail-Safes

* If a pod starts **without proper IRSA**, AWS SDK will fail with credential errors.
* Add readiness checks or launch-time validation.

| Helm Charts                       | Many support IRSA via serviceAccount annotations                          |
| Spark on K8s                      | ‚úÖ (need to set `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName`) |
| Flink                             | ‚úÖ if running in native K8s mode                                           |
| External Secrets / Vault Agent    | ‚úÖ IRSA can be used to authenticate to Secrets Manager, etc.               |

## üß™ IRSA vs Alternatives

| Auth Mechanism           | Description                                                     | When to Use                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **IRSA**                 | IAM role mapped to service account                              | ‚úÖ Preferred for AWS-native apps in EKS              |
| **IAM Instance Profile** | EC2 node role                                                   | ‚ùå Avoid‚Äîshared across pods                          |
| **Static AWS keys**      | Long-lived keys in env                                          | ‚ùå Dangerous; avoid in all prod use                  |
| **Vault with IAM auth**  | Pod authenticates to Vault using IRSA, gets short-lived secrets | ‚úÖ When using Vault as a centralized secrets manager |
