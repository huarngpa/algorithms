Orchestration tools like **Airflow**, **Dagster**, and **Temporal** are used to **manage, schedule, and monitor
workflows**, but they serve slightly different roles depending on the nature of your system (data pipelines vs
microservices). Understanding **when and why** to use each is crucial, especially for a **Coinbase Data
Foundations/Chain Stack** context.

---

## 🧠 First: What Is an Orchestrator?

A **workflow orchestrator**:

* Defines **multi-step workflows** (e.g., extract → transform → load).
* Manages **dependencies** between tasks.
* Handles **scheduling**, **retries**, **backfills**, **failures**, and **monitoring**.
* Often integrates with tools like **Spark**, **Kubernetes**, **Snowflake**, **S3**, etc.

## 💡 When Would You Use Each?

### 🟩 Use **Airflow** when:

* You have **existing batch data pipelines** (Spark, SQL, Python, etc.).
* You need to **schedule DAGs** with external system integration (S3, Kafka, Snowflake).
* Your team already knows Airflow (common in data orgs).
* You need a huge ecosystem of **plugins** and operators.

### 🟨 Use **Dagster** when:

* You want **typed, testable, modular pipelines**.
* You need **better developer ergonomics** than Airflow.
* You want **asset-level tracking** (e.g., "this table depends on this block file").
* You care about **data lineage**, versioning, and re-materialization.

### 🟥 Use **Temporal** when:

* You’re building **long-running, stateful workflows** (e.g., chain catchup jobs, retrying a block decoder).
* You need **event-driven orchestration**, e.g., on-chain events triggering downstream activity.
* You need exactly-once workflows **across microservices**, not just data.
* You’re working beyond just data pipelines—**backend workflows**, **retryable S3 uploads**, etc.

---

## 📦 Use Case Examples

### ✅ **Airflow Example**: Backfill Ethereum Block Data

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG("eth_block_backfill", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval="@daily") as dag:
    extract = BashOperator(
        task_id="extract",
        bash_command="python extract_blocks.py {{ ds }}"
    )

    transform = BashOperator(
        task_id="transform",
        bash_command="spark-submit transform_blocks.py {{ ds }}"
    )

    load = BashOperator(
        task_id="load",
        bash_command="python load_to_delta.py {{ ds }}"
    )

    extract >> transform >> load
```

* Run once per day for each date (e.g., block range per day).
* Backfill with `airflow dags backfill`.
* Retries if the job fails.

---

### ✅ **Dagster Example**: Re-materialize On-Chain Assets

```python
@asset
def raw_blocks():
    return extract_blocks_from_s3()

@asset
def normalized_blocks(raw_blocks):
    return normalize_block_data(raw_blocks)

@asset
def enriched_blocks(normalized_blocks):
    return enrich_with_metadata(normalized_blocks)
```

* Assets tracked as lineage graph.
* Partial re-runs, asset health checks.
* Good for **idempotent transformation** and **data versioning**.

---

### ✅ **Temporal Example**: Long-Running Chain Catchup Workflow

```python
@workflow.defn
class BlockCatchupWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, start_block: int, end_block: int):
        for block in range(start_block, end_block + 1):
            await workflow.execute_activity(fetch_block_data, block)
            await workflow.execute_activity(decode_and_store_block, block)
```

* Durable execution (survives restarts/crashes).
* Activities can **fail and retry** independently.
* Tracks state of each block’s progress over time.
* Great when jobs might take **hours/days**, or need external triggers.

## 🧠 Summary: Which Should I Use?

* **Airflow**: ✅ Mature, good for scheduling batch Spark/SQL pipelines. ✅ Use when simplicity and ecosystem matter.
* **Dagster**: 🧪 Modern, great for data asset versioning and lineage. ✅ Use when reactivity, re-materialization, and
  testability are critical.
* **Temporal**: 🧠 Best for event-driven, stateful, exactly-once workflows across services. ✅ Use when coordinating *
  *non-batch** processes (e.g., retries, catchups, human approvals, microservice orchestration).

Would you like a **mock design prompt** like:

> “Design an orchestrated pipeline to decode, normalize, and expose Ethereum transaction data using Spark,
> Airflow/Dagster, and S3/Delta Lake”?

I can walk you through how to structure your answer.

Absolutely. Let’s slow down and go deep with **real, concrete scenarios**—especially ones that could show up in a *
*Coinbase Chain Stack** or data engineering environment—and **walk through what the orchestration problem is**, and *
*why one tool is better than another** in that case.

We’ll take the same real-world use case and examine **how each tool handles it**, what pain points arise, and which tool
you’d probably reach for **as a senior engineer making architectural decisions**.

---

# 🔨 Use Case: Decode and Enrich Ethereum Blocks

Let’s say we:

1. Continuously ingest raw Ethereum blocks into S3 (as JSON blobs).
2. Want to decode them into structured fields.
3. Enrich with internal metadata (e.g., entity labels, price at time of tx).
4. Store the result in Delta Lake or Iceberg for analytics/ML.
5. Support replaying or fixing historical block ranges.
6. Maintain data quality and auditability.

---

# 🧩 Option 1: Apache Airflow

## ✅ Why You’d Use It

* You’re scheduling a **daily batch Spark job** (or hourly).
* You want to run transformations at regular intervals (not event-driven).
* You want to **backfill past days** if a job failed.
* You use external tools like Spark, Python, Bash—Airflow just coordinates them.

## 🤖 How It Looks

```python
# DAG to process a day's worth of Ethereum blocks
with DAG("process_blocks", schedule_interval="@daily") as dag:
    extract = PythonOperator(task_id="extract", python_callable=extract_raw_blocks)
    decode = BashOperator(task_id="decode", bash_command="spark-submit decode_blocks.py")
    enrich = PythonOperator(task_id="enrich", python_callable=enrich_blocks)
    store = PythonOperator(task_id="store", python_callable=write_to_delta)

    extract >> decode >> enrich >> store
```

### 🧠 When It Breaks Down

* You want to **reprocess just one block**. Airflow works at DAG granularity (e.g., day/hour), not per-entity (block).
* You want **data dependency tracking**: if `txs` asset was recomputed, should we reprocess `entities` too?
* Your pipelines are becoming **complex and branching**, and understanding what depends on what is hard.

---

# 🧩 Option 2: Dagster

## ✅ Why You’d Use It

* You want to track and re-run specific **data assets** (e.g., “block\_123456”).
* You want a **first-class concept of data lineage**: this table depends on that one.
* You want pipelines that are **testable**, **typed**, and more like real software.
* You care about **data freshness, versioning, or audits**.

## 🤖 How It Looks

```python
@asset
def raw_blocks(context) -> List[Dict]:
    return fetch_from_s3("raw_blocks")

@asset
def decoded_blocks(raw_blocks: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return decode_block_data(raw_blocks)

@asset
def enriched_blocks(decoded_blocks: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    return enrich_with_internal_metadata(decoded_blocks)
```

Dagster tracks:

* Which data assets exist and are fresh.
* What depends on what.
* If `raw_blocks` changes, downstream assets are invalidated.
* You can rerun **just one asset**, like `enriched_blocks`, and Dagster will **materialize only what’s needed**.

### 🧠 When It Breaks Down

* You need **fine-grained distributed state** (e.g., tracking block progress across a 100-hour catch-up job).
* You want **real-time, event-driven ingestion** (e.g., trigger on a new block event).
* You want **long-running retryable jobs** (not just scheduled tasks).

---

# 🧩 Option 3: Temporal

## ✅ Why You’d Use It

* You want to track progress of **every individual block** over time.
* You want workflows that **resume after crashes**, survive restarts.
* You want **event-driven workflows** (triggered when a new block is seen).
* You want **stateful retries**, e.g. re-fetch block if enrichment fails.
* You want **complex coordination across services**, not just a data pipeline.

## 🤖 How It Looks (Simplified)

```python
@workflow.defn
class BlockIngestionWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, block_number: int):
        raw_block = await workflow.execute_activity(fetch_block, block_number)
        decoded = await workflow.execute_activity(decode_block, raw_block)
        enriched = await workflow.execute_activity(enrich_block, decoded)
        await workflow.execute_activity(store_block, enriched)
```

Temporal gives you:

* Durable **per-block workflows** that track progress, retries, failures.
* Each step is an **activity** that can fail and resume.
* You can model things like:

  * “If a block is too large, split it into sub-jobs.”
  * “If decoding fails, try again in 30 mins.”
  * “If a block’s metadata is missing, wait for it to arrive.”

### 🧠 When It Breaks Down

* You want simple **batch processing** over thousands of blocks (e.g., Spark job).
* You want **data lineage or table awareness**.
* You're dealing purely with **data transformation**, not orchestration across microservices.

## 🧠 Real Thought Process: You're the Senior Engineer at Coinbase Chain Stack

### 💬 Scenario:

> The block enrichment job fails 1% of the time due to missing metadata. We want to retry it later, but only that block.
> We also need to guarantee no duplicates. Also, we occasionally get re-orgs and want to reprocess blocks 10–20 blocks
> deep.

* Airflow: Hard. It’s built around schedules, not event-driven retries.
* Dagster: Easier to detect asset invalidation. But retries have to be scripted or outside Dagster.
* Temporal: Built for it. Retry that one block in 30 minutes with exponential backoff. Resume at the step it failed.

### 💬 Scenario:

> We want to track freshness of `latest_normalized_tx_table` and have dashboards showing which tables are outdated and
> why.

* Airflow: Manual.
* Temporal: Not applicable.
* Dagster: Excellent. It’s **built around assets**. You can see which assets are stale, materialize on demand, backfill
  selectively.

### 💬 Scenario:

> The ETL job has grown 10x in volume. We need to split it by chain or shard and run the decode/enrich pipeline in
> parallel.

* Airflow: You’d write separate DAGs or parameterized DAGs.
* Dagster: Use `partitioned assets` to process by chain/date/block range.
* Temporal: Use **child workflows**, one per chain or range. Full control of execution graph.
