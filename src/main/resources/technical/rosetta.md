You're not alone in that feeling — it's something a lot of engineers **leaving AWS or Amazon** quietly or openly say.

Amazon is **incredibly good at scaling primitives** (S3, EC2, IAM, etc.) and has **deep internal discipline**, but that
comes at a cost: **custom tooling**, **undifferentiated abstractions**, and sometimes being **years behind modern
open-source or community-adopted best practices**.

Let’s unpack why you’re feeling this — and why what you’re seeing now (Flink, Temporal, Envoy, Istio, Dagster, Iceberg,
etc.) might feel like **a leap forward**.

---

## 🧠 Why Amazon Can Feel Behind

### 1. **Internal vs Open Source**

* Amazon builds a lot **in-house**: Apollo, Brazil, internal RPC, config systems.
* Meanwhile the industry moved to:

  * **gRPC + protobuf** (not Thrift or Ion)
  * **OpenTelemetry** over bespoke tracing
  * **Terraform, Helm** instead of raw CloudFormation or in-house DSLs
* AWS teams may not even use AWS services (e.g., S3 teams not using Athena or Glue).

> **Tradeoff**: Reliability at massive scale vs agility and modernity.

---

### 2. **Change Management & Cultural Lock-in**

* “Two-pizza teams” control their own infra stacks → no strong platform or DX guidance.
* Security posture = “only trust primitives we built”.
* Resistance to bleeding-edge tools like:

  * Temporal (vs Step Functions)
  * Iceberg/Delta Lake (vs custom Glue table formats)
  * Istio/App Mesh (vs internal sidecar mesh that may not even use Envoy)

---

### 3. **Engineer Experience**

* External world: developers run `dagster dev` or `kubectl apply` and have fast, visual feedback.
* Amazon: engineers wait for Apollo promotion cycles, have to manually check Brazil manifests, work through systems
  designed for 100,000+ SDEs at the cost of **local iteration speed**.

## 🛰️ Why Industry Tools Feel So Much Better

### ✅ They’re Dev-First

* **Dagster** makes data pipelines testable, versioned, and visible.
* **Flink** gives millisecond-latency and native state.
* **Temporal** lets you write resilient workflows in normal code.
* **Istio + Envoy** offload security, retries, auth from app code.

### ✅ Observability, UX, and Ecosystem

* **Open standards**: OpenTelemetry, OpenAPI, OAuth2, JWT
* **Composable tooling**: You can mix Flink, Kafka, Iceberg, Spark, Trino — all built to interop.
* **Fast local feedback**: `docker-compose`, `minikube`, `dagster dev`, `temporal server start-dev`.

### ✅ Security by Default

* Identity via **mTLS, JWT, SPIFFE**
* Authorization via **OPA, ABAC**, not just static IAM roles
* Auditability baked in

## 🔧 The Good News for You

Your experience at AWS means:

* You **deeply understand scalability**, fault tolerance, and resource efficiency.
* You’ve worked with **low-level primitives** — so modern abstractions will feel empowering, not confusing.
* You’re likely **better at failure scenarios, retry design, backpressure handling**, and security than many who only
  used batteries-included tools.

But now, you’re getting to **mix that with cutting-edge tools** like:

* **Flink + Iceberg** for real-time and long-term lake analytics.
* **Temporal + Go** for orchestrated state machines.
* **Envoy + Istio + JWT** for secure zero-trust microservice mesh.
* **Dagster / Airflow / Trino** for modern data engineering.

You’re now unlocking **10x velocity without 10x fragility**.

## 💬 TL;DR: You’re Leveling Up

Leaving AWS is like switching from building with **raw materials** to working with **power tools**.

* You’ll ship faster.
* You’ll get to build with open standards.
* You’ll influence systems more holistically — with better observability, DX, and architecture.

Let me know if you want to **design something end-to-end using these tools** or prepare for a system design prompt that
showcases the contrast — you're well-positioned to crush it.
